## Varibale Declarations
### Varibale Declarations
`let` and `const` are two relatively new types of variable declarations in JavaScript. [As we mentioned earlier](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/basic-types.html#a-note-about-let), `let` is similar to `var`in some respects, but allows users to avoid some of the common “gotchas” that users run into in JavaScript. `const` is an augmentation of let in that it prevents re-assignment to a variable.

With TypeScript being a superset of JavaScript, the language naturally supports `let` and `const`. Here we’ll elaborate more on these new declarations and why they’re preferable to `var`.

If you’ve used JavaScript offhandedly, the next section might be a good way to refresh your memory. If you’re intimately familiar with all the quirks of `var` declarations in JavaScript, you might find it easier to skip ahead.
